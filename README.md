Hi there, I'm Oluwaseyifunmi O. Yusuf!
🛡️ Cybersecurity Analyst | GRC Specialist | Network Engineer

I bridge the gap between technical security operations and Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC). With a strong foundation in Network Engineering and Legal Compliance, I specialize in designing secure infrastructures while ensuring they align with global standards like ISO 27001, NIST, GDPR, and PCI DSS.

Currently, I am focused on automating compliance workflows and enhancing threat detection using SIEM solutions.

🚀 What I Do

Governance & Compliance: Managing SOC 1/2, ISO 27001, and CSA STAR compliance programs.

Security Operations: Threat Intelligence, Incident Response, and SIEM Administration (Splunk, Wazuh, ELK).

Risk Management: Conducting risk assessments, maintaining risk registers, and reducing risk exposure (achieved 40% reduction in previous roles).

Network Security: Hardening endpoints, configuring firewalls/IDS/IPS, and optimizing network uptime.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

SIEM & Monitoring: Splunk, Wazuh, QRadar, Wireshark, Nagios.

Cloud & Identity: Azure, AWS, Active Directory (GPO management).

GRC Frameworks: ISO/IEC 27001, NIST CSF, GDPR, NDPA, PCI DSS.

Security Tools: Burp Suite, Mimikatz, Hydra (for simulation & testing).

💡 Featured Projects

Active Directory Security: Built an enterprise-like AD domain, enforcing ISO 27001-aligned policies and detecting simulated attacks (Brute Force/Lateral Movement) via Splunk.

SIEM Implementation (Wazuh): Developed custom detection rules that reduced incident response time by 35%.

GDPR Compliance Program: Spearheaded research aligning data processing with Article 30 requirements.
